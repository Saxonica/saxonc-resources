# saxonc-resources
This GITHub repository contains SaxonC resources with samples, unit tests and W3C test suite driver.

To run any of these samples you will have to install the SaxonC products (i.e. HE, PE and EE) from [download](https://saxonica.com/download/c.xml). The SaxonC products for python (i.e. saxonche, saxoncpe and saxoncee) can be installed using `pip install`, see the Saxonica [SaxonC PyPI project](https://pypi.org/user/saxonica/).
