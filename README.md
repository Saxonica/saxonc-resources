# saxonc-resources
This GITHub repository contains SaxonC resources with samples, unit tests and W3C test suite driver.

To run any of these samples you will have to install the SaxonC-HE product from [download](https://saxonica.com/download/c.xml). The saxonche product for Python can be installed using `pip install`, see the Saxonica [SaxonC PyPI project](https://pypi.org/user/saxonica/).  It is possible to run these sample files against SaxonC-PE or SaxonC-EE, by editing the build and sample files where there is a reference to HE and change it to either PE or EE where necessary.
